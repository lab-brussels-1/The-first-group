# Retrospective

In this project our team focused more on Planning and Collaboration than on the
final result. Thus we have managed to accomplish development part of the project
in time because of good team work!

## Stop Doing

- overthinking about "what we need to do" just start doing
- fine tune other's work
- try to do each step perfectly

## Continue Doing

- collaborate with a team during the project
- believe that done is better then perfect
- apply agile strategy
- create issues with clear and helpful labels, milestones for all things in the
  project scope so we can track our progress
- review PRs before merging

## Start Doing

- as a team, work on different tasks simultaneously to get result faster instead
  of waiting for the end of previous task

## Lessons Learned

- done better than perfect
- don't commit directly to main branch

---

  user stories in our Development strategy.
