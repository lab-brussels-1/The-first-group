          A tree is a tall plant with woody tissue. Trees gather light for
          photosynthesis through their leaves; this process creates “food” for
          the tree. Most of a tree trunk is dead tissue and serves only to
          support the weight of the tree crown. The outside layers of the tree
          trunk are the only living portion. The cambium produces new wood and
          new bark. The band of tissue outside of the cambium is the phloem.
          Phloem transports new materials (the sugars created from
          photosynthesis) from the crown to the roots. Dead phloem tissue
          becomes the bark of a tree,to know more about trees and planting got

        The tree can be everywhere, trees are normally a tall plant. All trees
        are gather light for photosynthesis through their leaves; this process
        creates “food” for the tree. Most of a tree trunk is dead tissue and
        serves only to support the weight of the tree crown. The outside layers
        of the tree trunk are the only living portion. The cambium produces new
